# Online MS Data Science Assignments


#### In this directory attached are some assignments that I have had throughout my masterâ€™s school work. My hope is to validate my ability to work and solve different types of problems. In all assignments I have either used R or Python to code and Markdown or Latex to generate the pdf. I have used multiple supervised and unsupervised techniques to solve the problems presented. 

#### I am excited to join a Data Science team where I can take the things that I have learned during the masters program and apply them to real world business problems that can help drive cost savings, value, and operational excellence. I look forward to meeting the team.
