# Online MS School Work and Assignments


#### In this directory attached are some assignments that I have had throughout my masterâ€™s school work. Not everything within the assignment will be 100% accurate as I was working on these assignments while learning the concepts. Regardless, my hope is to validate my ability to work and solve different types of problems. In all assignments I have either used R or Python to code and Markdown or Latex to generate the pdf. I have used multiple supervised and unsupervised techniques to solve the problems presented. I look forward to joining a Data Science team where I can take the things that I have learned through school and apply it to real world business problems that can help drive cost saving, value, and operational excellence. I look forward to meeting the team.
